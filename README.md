## Introduction

It is your first day at a new job as a Java engineer.
You have been given a task to create simple utility which will help other engineers generate fake data for their tests.

## Problem statement
In this task you have to implement all methods in the `Faker` class.

This class is responsible for generating sequence of characters from given input, with given wildcard rules:
- `letterify` method should replace each question mark character (?) with any **random** lower a-z letter.
- `numerify` method should replace each hash character (#) with any **random** 0-9 number
- `bothify` method should do both above operations

### Good Luck!

## Hints
Please pay attention to **correctness** but also to the **quality** of your solution.
